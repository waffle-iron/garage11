About
=====
Garage11 is a p2p webapp that features p2p blogging, chat and decentralized
(video)calls without needing a central signalling service. Each peer owns it's
own data and all data is end-to-end encrypted. Want to know more?

Just connect a browser node by visiting the [garage11 website]((https://garage11.io))
or connect a Node.js garage11 node by following the setup instructions!


Setup
=====
Make sure you have a recent Node.js version(5+) and Npm(3+) installed.

```
npm install -g garage11
garage11
```

Point a browser to `https://localhost:3000`. You just connected a browser node
to your own local Node.js garage11 node. You can also connect the Node.js node
to https://garage11.io with a websocket transport.
